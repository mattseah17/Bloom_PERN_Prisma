# Bloom

## Description

This is a plant tracker/ social media app for plant enthusiasts. I tend to forget to water my plants, so I started creating this app to help remind myself to take on the necessary actions to ensure my plants grow well. In the future, I will include other features e.g. users able to follow other users etc.

### Technologies Used

- Postgresql
- Prisma
- Express.js
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

### Wireframes

### User Stories

Users should be able to:

- Create an account
- Login to their accounts with the correct details
- Fetch their posts on their dashboard
- Update their personal details
- Add, edit or delete a plant and their actions
- Add or remove actions for each plant
- Navigate to different routes to see more details about the project, and input their details if they wish to edit their details or plant details

## Planning and Development Process

I wanted to use this project to apply what I have learnt for the past two weeks as much as possible, so I tried to implement most of the concepts. I thought about the hierarchy of components before going into coding. This helped me greatly as I was able to visualise how the data flow with positioning useStates at various components.

I spent some time modelling data before diving in. This is to ensure that I am able to visualise the relationships between tables and information I need for the app. Then, I started coding the various API endpoints, then I proceed to think about fetching data from the APIs.

React was manageable. I think it further deepens my knowledge on creating the frontend.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

I spent more time to console logging the output datatype, so that I know which methods to call in order to get what I want.
I managed to break down issues into smaller components this time. After finding the root of the issue, I was able to work my way up to resolve the bugs.

### Unsolved problems

- Uploading image URLs into the image input in the Add Plant form.
